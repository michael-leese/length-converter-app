## Length Conversion App ##

Practising my JS Fundamentals to create an App that will automatically return a converted 
value the _user_ inputs to an input box, which will convert to the selected length 
measurement unit that the user wishes to convert to.
First attempt will be to convert Meters into the others below.

| Metric     | Imperial |
|:----------:|:--------:|
| Kilometers |Miles     |
| Meters     |Yards     |
| Centimeters|Feet      |
| Millimeters|Inches    |


The final outcome for the App is to be able to use a selector box so the user may input whatever unit type 
they wish and convert the value to the other unit types automatically.

I will be using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap and Javascript to do this.  
The project is inspired by, and based upon the Traversy Media, 
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-ZAuU8TXc&t=0s&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=5),
Simple Weight Converter App which is demo'd in this video.

This is to better understand the Javascript Fundamentals Module undertaken with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
